# Compiler
#### It is a Compiler in python which takes as input a program which follows the grammar of minimal++ (C like language) and then is converted to C language which is finally converted to assembly and works normally like a normal programming language. The goal was to study and implement a compiler in order to understand how a programming language works and how the operating system interprets it.
